# Delegate payment foundation

## Scope and business rule

This milestone allows an existing **Professional Delegate** registration to pay through Paystack.
The current conference-controlled prices are USD 1,500.00 (`150000` cents) or NGN ₦2,100,000
(`210000000` kobo). The organizer approved the fixed NGN conversion basis of ₦1,400/USD:
`1,500 × 1,400 = 2,100,000`.

Both prices are independent, authoritative server-side database records. Checkout performs no live
FX lookup or browser-side conversion. A future price or approved conversion basis must be applied
through a reviewed database migration rather than fetched from a market-rate service.

Sponsor, exhibitor, Student Delegate, refunds, manual overrides, settlement reconciliation,
invoicing, and accounting are outside this milestone.

## Architecture and security

```text
registration reference
  -> DelegatePaymentService
  -> registration + delegate_package_prices (trusted amount)
  -> payment_transactions snapshot
  -> PaymentService
  -> PaystackProvider
  -> hosted Paystack checkout
```

The browser sends a registration reference and requested supported currency only. It never sends
an authoritative amount. `DelegatePaymentService` loads the registration, Professional package,
and requested active price from PostgreSQL, then snapshots `PROFESSIONAL`, the selected currency,
and its current approved amount on the payment attempt before calling Paystack.

Paystack requires initialization from the backend, amounts in currency subunits, and a unique
reference. Its verification response must be checked for status and amount before value is
delivered. See the official [Transaction API](https://paystack.com/docs/api/transaction/) and
[Accept Payments guide](https://paystack.com/docs/payments/accept-payments/).

No card number, CVV, full authorization object, raw provider payload, or provider secret is stored.
Development logging contains method/path/status only and does not log request bodies or query
strings.

## Data model

- `delegate_package_prices`: unique `(package_id, currency)`, `USD | NGN`, positive minor-unit
  amount, and independent active flag. Professional USD and NGN are currently active and this table
  is authoritative for checkout.
- Legacy `delegate_packages.currency` and `price_minor` remain temporarily so the existing package
  API and registration UI keep working. They should be retired only in a separately reviewed
  compatibility migration.
- `payment_transactions`: one row per attempt, with provider reference, trusted snapshots, small
  state, safe checkout URL/access code, useful outcome fields, and confirmation-email state.
- `payment_events`: at most one meaningful initialized, confirmed, and verification-failed event
  per payment. It intentionally excludes provider noise and sensitive payloads.

Detailed attempt states are `INITIALIZED`, `PENDING`, `PAID`, `FAILED`, `ABANDONED`, and
`REVERSED`. A delegate registration stays `PENDING` after an attempt fails so another attempt may
be made. It changes to `PAID` only after trusted confirmation.

Pricing migrations never update `payment_transactions`. A payment initialized under an earlier
price retains its original currency and amount snapshot even after current package prices change.

## Initialization, retries, and concurrency

`POST /api/delegate-registrations/:reference/payment/initialize` accepts exactly:

```json
{ "currency": "USD" }
```

or:

```json
{ "currency": "NGN" }
```

The service locks the registration while resolving eligibility and creating an attempt. A partial
unique index permits only one `INITIALIZED` or `PENDING` attempt for a registration. A repeat call
returns an already-created hosted checkout when available; a simultaneous call while the provider
request is in flight gets a safe conflict response. Provider failure marks the attempt `FAILED`,
which permits a new server-generated reference on retry. A failed/abandoned attempt never changes
the registration to paid.

The provider call occurs after the database transaction so row locks are not held across network
I/O. If a process interruption leaves an `INITIALIZED` row without any checkout URL, the repository
keeps it reserved for two minutes, then marks only that orphan `ABANDONED` before allowing a retry.
No customer received the lost checkout URL, and the orphan cannot become paid without verified
provider confirmation.

## Verification and webhook

`GET /api/payments/:reference/verify` loads the local snapshot and calls Paystack Verify. A success
is accepted only when all of these match:

- local and provider references;
- provider status `success`;
- exact integer minor-unit amount;
- exact currency;
- normalized customer email and registration email.

Finalization locks the payment and registration rows. Repeated verification or webhook delivery
sees the already-paid row and produces no second business event or email.

`POST /api/payments/paystack/webhook` is public but authenticates the exact raw JSON bytes with
HMAC-SHA512 and the backend Paystack secret key before parsing the event. This follows Paystack's
official [webhook signature guidance](https://paystack.com/docs/payments/webhooks/). The initial
milestone processes `charge.success`; unknown references and signed mismatches are acknowledged
without changing payment truth. Missing or invalid signatures receive `401`.

The callback page is user experience only. It reads the reference and asks the backend to verify;
query parameters can never mark a registration paid.

## Confirmation email and Admin access

The first successful state transition sends one provider-neutral Mailjet confirmation attempt after
the database commit. Failure is recorded as `FAILED` on the notification field and logged with only
the safe payment reference and error type. Payment remains `PAID`. Replayed verification/webhooks
do not send the email again.

`GET /api/admin/payments` and `GET /api/admin/payments/:reference` require `payments.read`.
`FINANCE` and `SUPER_ADMIN` have this permission. Other staff may still see the registration's
coarse payment status when their existing delegate permission allows it, but they do not gain full
financial records.

## Environment and Paystack test mode

Obtain a **test secret key** from the Paystack Dashboard test-mode API Keys & Webhooks area. Put it
only in the untracked `backend/.env`:

```env
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=your-test-secret-key
PAYSTACK_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:5173/registration/payment/callback
```

There is no `PAYSTACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Paystack signs webhooks with the same account secret key.
Never prefix either setting with `VITE_`, paste it into React, commit it, or include it in Postman
examples.

For a remotely reachable development webhook, use a secure tunnel and configure this test-mode URL
in Paystack:

```text
https://your-test-host.example/api/payments/paystack/webhook
```

Localhost cannot receive Paystack's server-to-server webhook. The browser callback may remain
localhost. Use only Paystack test instruments; for example, the official
[Test Payments guide](https://paystack.com/docs/payments/test-payments/) lists the reusable success
card `4084 0840 8408 4081`, any future expiry date, and CVV `408`. Never use real money or a live
key for development or automated tests.

Production dependency: **Confirm international/USD payment capability on the organizer's Paystack
business before enabling live USD checkout.** USD support in the architecture or Paystack's market
documentation does not prove that this specific business is enabled. A Paystack
`unsupported_currency` response must not be bypassed and must not silently convert a USD attempt
to NGN. NGN checkout remains an independent option.

## Postman/manual acceptance flow

1. Create a Professional Delegate with `POST /api/delegate-registrations`. Expect a generated
   registration reference and payment `PENDING`.
2. Send `POST /api/delegate-registrations/:reference/payment/initialize` with
   `{"currency":"USD"}`. Expect USD, `amountMinor: 150000`, an authorization URL, and a payment
   reference. Repeat with a separate eligible registration and `{"currency":"NGN"}`; expect NGN
   and `amountMinor: 210000000`.
3. Inspect each local row. Expect `INITIALIZED` or `PENDING` and the selected authoritative price:

   ```sql
   SELECT provider_reference, status, currency, amount_minor
   FROM payment_transactions
   WHERE provider_reference = 'the-returned-reference';
   ```

4. Open the returned Paystack **test** authorization URL.
5. Complete checkout with a Paystack test instrument.
6. Let Paystack return the browser to `/registration/payment/callback`.
7. Confirm the callback calls `GET /api/payments/:reference/verify`.
8. Inspect both records. Expect both to be `PAID`:

   ```sql
   SELECT pt.status AS payment_status, dr.payment_status AS registration_payment_status
   FROM payment_transactions pt
   JOIN delegate_registrations dr ON dr.id = pt.registration_id
   WHERE pt.provider_reference = 'the-returned-reference';
   ```

9. Sign in as a Finance Admin and open `/admin/payments`; confirm the transaction appears.
10. Sign in as a role without `payments.read`; `GET /api/admin/payments` must return `403`.
11. Repeat the verify request. It remains `PAID` with no duplicate effects.
12. Replay the same correctly signed webhook in a controlled test. It remains `PAID`, with one
    `PAYMENT_CONFIRMED` event and no duplicate confirmation email.
13. Use mocked-provider automated tests for amount mismatch. Expected: payment is not `PAID`.
14. Repeat with a currency mismatch. Expected: payment is not `PAID`.
15. Complete the flow independently for NGN. If USD returns Paystack `unsupported_currency`, record
    it as an organizer merchant-capability blocker and do not convert or retry the attempt as NGN.

Useful inspection queries:

```sql
SELECT dp.slug, dpp.currency, dpp.amount_minor, dpp.is_active
FROM delegate_package_prices dpp
JOIN delegate_packages dp ON dp.id = dpp.package_id;

SELECT event_type, created_at
FROM payment_events
WHERE payment_transaction_id = 'payment-uuid'
ORDER BY created_at;
```
